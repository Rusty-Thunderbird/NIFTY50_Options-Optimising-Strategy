## Colab-Based Options Backtesting Notebook

This notebook presents a **production-quality backtesting framework** for NIFTY 50 options strategies, designed to run on **Google Colab** with seamless integration to **Google Drive** for data access and persistence. It is structured for **quantitative researchers, systematic traders, and engineering teams** looking to prototype or validate options strategies with high fidelity.

### Key Features

#### 1. Project Structure and Data Handling

- Mounts Google Drive to enable large dataset access and persistent storage  
- Loads multiple synchronized datasets:
  - NIFTY 50 1-minute spot price data  
  - Minute-level options chain (all strikes, expiries, CE/PE)  
  - India VIX data for volatility-based filters  
  - Precomputed trading signals (1-min resolution)  
- Efficiently slices and filters data by date range for modular backtesting

#### 2. Configurable Backtest Engine

- All key parameters defined at the top:  
  capital, lot size, risk per trade, take-profit/stop-loss thresholds,  
  slippage, brokerage, VIX window, and spread width  
- Consistent timezone localization (`Asia/Kolkata`) for accurate trade execution in Indian markets  
- Modular loading functions for each data source

#### 3. Strategy Execution

- Supports both:
  - **Long Option Trades** (ATM directional trades based on breakout signals)
  - **Credit Spreads** (Bull Put and Bear Call spreads with VIX regime and trend filters)  
- Dynamic position sizing based on capital, volatility, and margin requirements  
- Realistic order execution modeling:
  - Slippage and brokerage on both entry and exit  
  - Liquidity-aware strike and expiry selection  
  - Stop-loss, take-profit, and expiry-based exits

#### 4. Performance Tracking and Reporting

- Full trade log with metadata:  
  entry/exit time, instrument, strike, quantity, price, PnL, reason for exit, etc.  
- Summary statistics printed inline, including:
  - Initial and final capital  
  - Total return, max drawdown  
  - Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios  
  - Win/loss breakdown, average/best/worst trade  
  - Trade duration and time window  
- Trade logs and outputs saved to CSV for reproducibility and further analysis

#### 5. Versioned Evolution

The notebook demonstrates progression across versions:

- Early versions focus on basic directional trades with minimal cost modeling  
- Intermediate versions add stop-loss logic, signal granularity, and better performance realism  
- Final version includes:
  - Full buy-side and sell-side integration  
  - VIX regime-based filters  
  - Expiry-aware execution and margin simulation  
  - Realistic performance metrics  
    - Sharpe: **1.53**  
    - Return: **14.60%**  
    - Max Drawdown: **â‚¹74,259.32**

#### 6. Engineering Best Practices

- Modular, reusable function design  
- Transparent parameterization and assumptions  
- All steps are reproducible and auditable  
- Designed to scale with minimal changes to support new instruments or strategies
